- for compilation of project g++-5 is needed
- use three commands below to install g++-5

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-5.1 g++-5.1 


After that cd to SamplePlugin dir
cd /..mypath.../SamplePluginPA10

It might be necessary to give executable permissions to the file recompileProject
- right click on the file, select properties, then Permissions tab and finally tick the checkbox Execute in the bottom of page

then run recompileProject sh script
./recompileProject

Load the sample plugin to robworkstudio like described in finalproject statement

For simulation I suggest you to lower deltaT value to cca 300ms. Otherwise it is really slow. You can do it after plugin is loaded with the SpinBox
